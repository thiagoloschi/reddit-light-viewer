### Description
This is a light viewer for reddit, where you can look for a subreddit and see related content on a list of posts. Posts are clickable and will open the websites in a new tab. The ideia in the future is to have an iframe like to display the website in the same tab. As it is a Progressive Web App, it can be installed to mobile devices right to their home screen, where it will behave just like a regular native app.  

<br /> 

### Technologies
PWA, React, Redux, Webpack, Nodejs, Styled-components, Jest, Enzyme.

<br />
